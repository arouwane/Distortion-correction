# Distortion-correction
An open-source library designed for automatically identifying distortion fields within image mosaics.
Provided sufficient grey-level gradient (speckle like texture), a distortion function can be identified. 
The identified fields enable the subsequent correction of mosaic images, leading to improved stitching results. 
This code represents an addition to the extensive and varied literature on image stitching.
